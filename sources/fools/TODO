Architecture
------------
- finish scheme system
    - fix fib evaluation bugs
    - figure out a good way of writing scheme natives in terms of message
      sends
    - look at importing existing scheme parsers and syntax compilers
    - setup a scheme REPL with access to the system
- finish smalltalk system
    - attach a lookup written in scheme to all classes as interpreter
    - hand-build the basic meta-hierarchy with a C method to build new
      instances.
    - import smalltalk parser written in scheme or compile to our C format
      from within smalltalk (some peg...)


Roadmap
-------
- look at interaction with GTK; try to import glamour and use it to build an
  initial IDE and debugger.
- try to get pthreads working.


VM Optimizations
----------------

- Make sure symbols known to the VM are not constantly calculated but static
    - DONE
    - make sure symbols are still known to the runtime.
- Think about a symbol table in general. And give symbols a different class.
- Rewrite iList>>eval to directly queue all actions in the list rather than
  always returning and continuing.
- check if Const is required or not.
