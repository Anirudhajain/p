Architecture
------------
- finish scheme system
    - subscope of iscoped>>scope rather than the passed env
    - figure out a good way of writing scheme natives in terms of message
      sends -> better than the current "native()" approach
    - look at importing existing scheme parsers and syntax compilers
    - setup a scheme REPL with access to the system
- finish smalltalk system
    - DONE attach a lookup written in scheme to all classes as interpreter
    - DONE hand-build the basic meta-hierarchy with a C method to build new
           instances.
    - import smalltalk parser written in scheme or compile to our C format
      from within smalltalk (some peg...)


Roadmap
-------
- look at interaction with GTK; try to import glamour and use it to build an
  initial IDE and debugger.
- try to get pthreads working.
- own GC (necessary for multithreading)

VM Optimizations
----------------
- Inline env->values in env for faster alloc. Maybe even make env-stack
- Make sure symbols known to the VM are not constantly calculated but static
    - DONE
    - make sure symbols are still known to the runtime.
- Think about a symbol table in general. And give symbols a different class.
- Make the argument evaluation of lambdas part of the C-system rather than
  meta-circular

Language Hacks
--------------
- actors
- multimethods
    - multiple method lookup implementations
    - traits-only system?
- automatic curry
- prolog

Pinocchio
---------
"A true relationship has to be based on reciprocal subjective appreciation of
the other person as a person. Bridging that gap will require alot of effort
from both Geppetto and Pinocchio."
