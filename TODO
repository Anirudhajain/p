Architecture
------------
- Input stream mind UTF8 (see file.c)
- finish peg
- Think about a symbol table in general. And give symbols a different class.
    - make sure symbols are still known to the runtime.
- replace error guard text messages with message objects
- make ast classes extendable (a class for each type)
- subscope of iscoped>>scope rather than the passed env
- figure out a good way of writing scheme natives in terms of message
  sends -> better than the current "native()" approach
- setup a scheme REPL with access to the system
- import smalltalk parser written in scheme or compile to our C format
  from within smalltalk (some peg...)

Roadmap
-------
- look at interaction with GTK; try to import glamour and use it to build an
  initial IDE and debugger.
- try to get pthreads working.
- own GC (necessary for multithreading)

VM Optimizations
----------------
- Inline env->values in env for faster alloc. Maybe even make env-stack
- Make the argument evaluation of lambdas part of the C-system rather than
  meta-circular

Language Hacks
--------------
- actors
- multimethods
    - multiple method lookup implementations
    - traits-only system?
- automatic curry
- prolog

Pinocchio
---------
"A true relationship has to be based on reciprocal subjective appreciation of
the other person as a person. Bridging that gap will require alot of effort
from both Geppetto and Pinocchio."
