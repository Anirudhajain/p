Cleanup
-------
- move asSymbol from String to Object
- move all core classes to separate files

Architecture
------------
- finish peg
- Think about a symbol table in general. 
    - make sure symbols are still known to the runtime.
- make ast classes extendable (a class for each type)
- replace error guard text messages with message objects
- figure out a good way of writing scheme natives in terms of message
  sends -> better than the current "native()" approach
- setup a scheme REPL with access to the system
- subscope of iscoped>>scope rather than the passed env
- stderr stream

Primitives
----------
- add some char to int transformation

Roadmap
-------
- look at interaction with GTK; try to import glamour and use it to build an
  initial IDE and debugger.
- try to get pthreads working.
- own GC (necessary for multithreading)

VM Optimizations
----------------
- Inline env->values in env for faster alloc. 

Language Hacks
--------------
- actors
- multimethods
    - multiple method lookup implementations
    - traits-only system?
- automatic curry
- prolog

Pinocchio
---------
"A true relationship has to be based on reciprocal subjective appreciation of
the other person as a person. Bridging that gap will require alot of effort
from both Geppetto and Pinocchio."
